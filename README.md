# Gemäuer

A browser-based tabletop game engine. Provides a zoomable, pannable canvas for placing tiles, cards, and nested game stages.

## Running

No build step. Serve the project with any static file server (e.g. Live Server on port 5500). The app uses native ES Modules (`<script type="module">`), so opening `index.html` directly via `file://` will not work due to CORS restrictions — a server is required.

## Menu

- **New** — creates a game stage with a hand and a deck
- **Save** — downloads the current state as `gemaeuer.json`
- **Load** — restores a previously saved state

## Interactions

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Double-click on stage | Places a tile |
| Right-click on stage | Creates a nested stage |
| Click on deck | Draws a card into the hand |
| Click on card/tile | Selects it (shows properties in settings panel) |
| Click on empty stage | Clears the selection |
| Flip button in panel | Flips the selected card/tile |
| Hold + drag card/tile | Picks it up and moves it |
| Drop card near bottom | Adds it to the hand |
| Mouse near bottom | Raises the hand |
| Scroll wheel | Zooms the viewport |
| Drag on empty area | Pans the viewport |

## Architecture

Plain JavaScript, no bundler. ES Modules with a single entry point:

```

### Layers

**core/** — Object lifecycle, persistence, and foundational infrastructure. `StateObject` is the base class for all serialisable state. `ObjectRegistry` is a singleton with a type registry — classes register themselves via `objectRegistry.register("TYPE", Class)` and the registry instantiates them by type string with a simple map lookup. `registry.js` is a barrel that imports all constructable classes so their registration side effects run at startup. `DataManager` is the central registry that creates, stores, and serialises everything. `EventBus` is the global event bus — objects emit named events and subscribe to each other without direct references.

**rendering/** — The render loop and DOM update layer. The `Renderer` singleton owns a `requestAnimationFrame` loop that batches DOM writes. Game objects call `renderer.setState()` to mutate visual state; the Renderer computes screen bounds and applies styles once per frame. Game objects can also trigger one-shot CSS transitions via `renderer.startTransition()` without directly manipulating the DOM — the Renderer guards transitioning properties from being overwritten by the dirty-flag loop. Also centralizes mouse input handling (hit testing, drag capture, wheel bubbling) and provides coordinate conversion utilities (`screenToLocal`, `localToViewport`). See `rendering/rendering.architecture.md` for detailed diagrams.

**zui/** — The zoomable UI framework. `ZoomableElement` is the base for anything on a stage (positioning, drag/drop, coordinate conversion). `ZoomableObject` and `FlippableObject` extend it with SVG rendering. `Stage` is a container with its own `ViewPort` (pan/zoom), `StageZIndexManager` (layering), and optional `StageSelectionManager` (selection). `Panel` is a generic UI container for text and buttons (used as the settings panel). `RootObject` is the top-level container wrapping the browser window. `config/` holds `LayoutPresets` and `UIDefinitions`.

**game/** — Game objects built on the zui layer. `GameStage` extends `Stage` with tile/card creation and hand interaction. `Tile` and `Card` are `FlippableObjects`. `Deck` spawns cards. `Hand` manages a fan of cards at the bottom of the stage that raises/lowers on cursor proximity.

### Key concepts

- **ES Modules** — all files use `import`/`export`. No globals. The browser resolves the dependency graph from `main.js`.
- **Singletons** — `svgLoader` (from `assets/SVGLoader.js`), `dataManager` (from `core/DataManager.js`), `objectRegistry` (from `core/ObjectRegistry.js`), `eventBus` (from `core/EventBus.js`), and `renderer` (from `rendering/Renderer.js`) are module-level instances, imported where needed.
- **Object registry** — each class self-registers with `objectRegistry.register("TYPE", Class)` at module level. The barrel `core/registry.js` imports all classes to ensure registration runs before any `create()` call. To add a new type: create the class, add a `register` call, and add one import to `registry.js`.
- **Event bus** — objects communicate via named events through a global `eventBus` singleton (`core/EventBus.js`). See `events.md` for the full event vocabulary and interaction flows.
- **Selection** — `StageSelectionManager` tracks which WORLD objects are selected. Nested stages share the parent's manager (passed via state). Clicking an object selects it; clicking empty stage space clears. The manager emits `selection:changed` via the event bus; `GameStage` listens and updates the settings panel. Selection is transient (not serialized).
- **State/behaviour split** — every object has a `StateObject` subclass (`XxxState`) holding serialisable state, and a live class holding logic.
- **Layout presets** — objects use `LayoutPresets.WORLD`, `.SCREEN`, or `.SCREEN_RELATIVE` to define how they position and size themselves. See `zui/config/LayoutPresets.js` for details.
- **DataManager** — central registry and factory. Owns `rootObject`. Single entry point for creating, retrieving, saving, and loading objects.
- **SVG data** — raw SVG strings live in `assets/svgData/` as module exports. The barrel file `index.js` re-exports all. Add new SVGs there.

## Startup sequence

1. Modules load: `main.js` imports `svgLoader`, `dataManager`, `renderer`, and `registry.js` (which triggers all class registrations with `objectRegistry`)
2. `DOMContentLoaded` fires → `svgLoader.loadAll()` parses all SVG data
3. `RootObjectState` is created and passed to `dataManager.createObject()` → `RootObject` is built (viewport + z-index manager)
4. `dataManager.rootObject` is set
5. `renderer.start(document.getElementById('content'))` — starts the render loop and attaches input listeners
6. User clicks **New** to create a `GameStage` with a `Hand` and `Deck`
